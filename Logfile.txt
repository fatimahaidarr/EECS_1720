I edited the code we did today by changing the shape from an ellipse to a quad, the color, and the extermities where the shape is drawn.

I added 'Im The Walker' text as I was looking through the refrences and experimenting with them.
I also changed the position of the Walker (quad) in the canvas.

I added another condition for the code that was provided which is to change the color of the background at a certain place in the canvas.
